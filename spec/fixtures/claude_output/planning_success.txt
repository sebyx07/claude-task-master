I'll analyze the codebase and create a comprehensive plan for building a REST API with authentication.

After exploring the project structure, I can see this is a Ruby application. Let me create a detailed implementation plan.

I'm writing the plan to .claude-task-master/plan.md:

# Plan for: Build a REST API with authentication

## PR 1: Core API Structure and Database Setup
- [ ] Task 1.1: Set up database schema for users table
- [ ] Task 1.2: Create User model with validations
- [ ] Task 1.3: Add bcrypt for password hashing
- [ ] Task 1.4: Create base API controller

## PR 2: Authentication System
- [ ] Task 2.1: Implement user registration endpoint
- [ ] Task 2.2: Implement login endpoint with JWT
- [ ] Task 2.3: Add JWT authentication middleware
- [ ] Task 2.4: Create protected API endpoints
- [ ] Task 2.5: Add tests for authentication flow

## PR 3: API Documentation and Testing
- [ ] Task 3.1: Add API documentation
- [ ] Task 3.2: Write integration tests
- [ ] Task 3.3: Ensure 80%+ test coverage

The plan has been created. I'm now updating the state to "ready" to proceed with implementation.
