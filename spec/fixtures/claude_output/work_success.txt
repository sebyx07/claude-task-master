Working on: Set up database schema for users table

I'll create the migration for the users table and the User model.

Created db/migrate/20260114_create_users.rb with the users table including:
- id (primary key)
- email (string, unique)
- password_digest (string)
- timestamps

Created app/models/user.rb with:
- bcrypt password hashing
- email validations (presence, uniqueness, format)
- password length validations

Running the migration...
Migration completed successfully.

Running tests...
All tests pass.

Updating state files:
- Marked Task 1.1 as complete in plan.md
- Updated current_task to "Create User model with validations" in state.json

Task completed. Ready to continue with next task.
